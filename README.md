## Introduction
At first, this program generates some data based on the defined probability distribution functions, and then it estimates a function using a root function named as [TKDE](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTKDE.html) which is similar to the Gaussian kernel density estimation. 
## How to Run the Program?
This program can be run in a root terminal. Open your root terminal by typing ***``root``*** in your main terminal and after that use the command [root] ***``.x estim.C(int=1000)``***. <br>
One needs to pass an integer to run this program. This integer will be equal to the number of the data points. I have made a plot for 1000 data points, and it is in the file directory.
